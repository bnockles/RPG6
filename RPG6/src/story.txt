You run left as far as you can. Around you, all you can see are the corpses of your neighbors and friends.
You pass by your house on the way, and it doesnt seem like anyone will ever make it out.
You continue to run as far as you can. Some years from now you happen upon a new
    kingdom fighting against the villians who destoryed your village.
You run right as far as you can. Around you, all you can see are the corpses of your neighbors and friends
